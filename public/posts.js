  "post":"I spent the last two weeks in CO, attending ETH Denver as a hacker and mentor. I also spent 6 days in the mountains, skiing out West for the first time and going on adventures. It was a really great experience, and I definitely want to go back in the summer time. CO is a beautiful part of the country.<br><br>At Eth Denver I gave a workshop on building ERC-721 tokens on Ethereum.  You can watch it <a href='https://youtu.be/49G5eFFu_NE' >here.</a> I think a lot of the learning content in this space is either “Hello World” or really deep dives. The difference between the ends of this spectrum is really vast and many developers I’ve talked to have had a hard time getting past the many beginner tutorials. So the focus of my workshop was on practical integration, and we spent more than half of the time doing live coding and explaining everything as we go. For me, that’s the best way to learn.<br><br>After ETH Denver many of the organizers and participants went on a retreat to Breckenridge, CO, for skiing.  I met my Dad in Denver, who flew in from Boston. We drove together to Breckenridge and met up with some ETH Denver folks, but mostly skied just the two of us. It was an awesome place. We also did some day trips to some hot springs and went on a snow shoeing hike too. I bet it’s awesome there in the summer. One of the highlights was playing poker with friends, and my Dad totally hustling everyone. It’s funny to see this older guy come in and smoke a bunch of cockie young crytpo hotshots. It was a great trip. ",

  "post":"This is a letter to myself to reflect on where I am now, what is next, why I’m doing it, and give myself a reference for where I was when I return. <b> Today marks less than a month until I leave for my thru hike attempt of the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine.</b>  I’m planning to leave May 1st, 2019, and to go on a great adventure, which I hope to finish in just under 5 months.<br><br>Right now, I am 23 years old, relatively fit, medium length hair, and wearing a red sweatshirt that says Newport which I got for Christmas. I weigh 167 lbs, which is as much as I have ever weighed in my life. I used to exercise more, I used to write more code, I used to spend more time with friends, I used to go outside more. I wish I did those more, but maybe not doing them is a consequence of graduating college and going into ‘real life’. Maybe it’s just how it is. I’ve built a lot of great things in the last year, and had some significant accomplishments in terms of my business and projects, but I’ve also felt myself stagnating and not being as challenged as I used to be. This hike will be a great chance to make friends, to exercise all day, to be outside in the woods. But that’s not necessarily why I am taking 5 months off to do it.<br><br>What am I hoping and expecting to find on this hike? I’m not sure exactly. A trip. An adventure. A change. All of those for sure, but that doesn’t fully capture my eagerness to attempt this thru hike. I’m sure I will meet a lot of great people, see a lot of great things, and have some great experiences. But I think most of all I’m looking for a challenge: an experience that is also an accomplishment. I love being in the woods. I’m not afraid of the bears, or people, or logistics. I’m afraid I will miss something when I’m gone, I’m afraid relationships I care about will be strained, I’m afraid I won’t finish by the end of September and it will get too cold. I’ve been thinking about this hike for about three years. It seems now will be the best time in my life to finally take the leap and do it. I have no serious commitments, who knows when that will be true again.<br><br>How am I feeling? Great! I’m anxious to get back out into the woods. Sometimes I feel like I live a life of extremes, occasionally programming on my computer for 18 hours at a time, but then going on extended adventures in the woods. Both of those things make me happy. Just because I like what I do doesn't mean it's not time for a change. I’m having a great time, and excited to get on with my thru hike attempt.<br><br>I say thru hike ‘attempt’, but I don’t think I will quit. I know it will not be easy. I’m ready.",

Mostly it's pretty standard, I've got a big pack, minimal clothes, tent, sleeping bag, water filter kit, the basics, etc.. Some things are a bit unique to me. I'm bring a 360 degree camera, the Insta360 ONE. My sleeping pad is the blowup type, instead of foam. Most people I've talked to recommend foam since it's extra work to use the blow up kind, but I prefer it. I'm bringing a tiny solar-powered lantern for if I'm walking along a road at dusk to hang on my back and to have around... I just like it.  Some friends and family (who admittedly haven’t done as much research or hiked as far as I have) told me I should bring a big knife (or even a gun?!)… No, bad idea. Instead, I have a tiny knife, shorter than the top segment of my thumb for cutting slices of cheese, and that’s pretty much all I plan to use it for. And I spread my peanut butter with the handle of my spork. I think most people also bring a hamock tent, but I prefer my bivy.<br></br>My goal is for my pack weight to be less than 25 lbs before food. I will probably ditch things I feel I don’t need, and there are lots of places to get more things if I feel I’m missing something.<br><br>Bags are almost packed, I’m almost ready to go!",

It was foggy at the top, no view, so I didn’t delay and stop there, plus I heard there’s pizza at Neels Gap, at the bottom.  Many people (some that I had been hiking with found the mountain so challenging that by the time they got to the top they had already quit.  As such, at the bottom of the mountain there is a huge oak tree. In the oak there are hundreds of shoes, tied together at the laces. And when hikers quit they throw their shoes up into the tree, as a final I QUIT!  I don’t think I will quit, but I’m seeing several of the folks I started with quitting early. And people going slow, taking a week+ to get to Neels Gap, will quit. I got over it on the morning of my third day. Regardless, it’s a cool tree.",

Everyone was friendly, but there were a few hard peaks and I went slow. Feeling worn out tonight, as I stopped early, around 4pm and am journaling in the shelter. I met Munchy, he ate all his food for a week in 2 days after smoking too much weed. I met Moccasins, who has moccasins instead of sandals for camp shoes. And lots of other friendly people that are not thru hiking. At the shelter an old guy who is completing the trail in 50 mile sections over the last 40 years gave me his extra fruit snacks since he was getting off tomorrow, so now I’m happy.  I’ve mostly been hiking with Meow, Big Man, Lola, and Refugee. But Meow and Lola kept going and are way ahead.

I was feeling unmotivated in the afternoon but then I saw Albert Mountain on my map. A huge steep climb, which made me grimace. But then I remembered I had been here before! In 2017 for the solar eclipse I drove down to NC with Abi, Avi, and Jeff. There’s a fire tower on top of Albert Mountain we were going to go up to see the eclipse, but it was too crowded. After I remembered that awesome trip and being on the mountain with my friends, I had a great hike over it. Got some great pictures on the top of the fire tower I will share here as soon as I figure out how to embed 360 images.",

It’s nice to see familiar friendly faces when you get to a shelter and get out of the rain. <br> I also met a couple from Maine who needed a new carabiner to hang their food bag, so I gave them one of mine and we hung our bear bags together. Every night I hang my food at least 8 feet up or put it in a bear box if there is one. This couple started 3 days after me, and they have super nice gear & hiker very fast.

Today I’ve already gone over an area that was very burned in forest fires 2 years ago. Then i passed the Wesser Bald Fire Tower, which was 4600 feet up and had incredible views. I met 2Pack and Slowpoke up there and took some 360 shots. Then I got to the Jump Off, which is like walking along the spine of a giant dinosaur. It’s not too steep but the trail is very thin and right along the ridge of the mountains. It was the most memorable section of trail I’ve done so far. I took some great 360 shots there too.

Moss is trying to create ‘sense memories’ by touching the moss on the sides of trees while they hike. okay….. Everyone else is tenting tonight because there are TONS of MASSIVE spiders in the shelter. I don’t think they will bother me. We have a common enemy, the evil mosquitos. By the way, I have a million little bug bites and tiny scratches that I don’t know where they came from.

I paid $20 for a thru hiker pass to stay in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which I enter after Fontana Dam, and printed it out at the outfitter in NOC. There are lots of rules there. Everyone has to say exactly what shelter they are staying in which day, and you’re only allowed to stay in shelters, no camping in random places. Thru Hikers have some special privileges, like being able to stay in any given shelter, but we have to give up our spots to hikers with reservations. Just a short (extremely wet and cold) hike in the afternoon to the next shelter, which was nearly full. Luckily I got a space. The Maine Couple & Yeehaw were there, who I met at Albert Mountain but he didn’t have a trail name then.<br><br>Everyone said there would come a day when I would just have to hike in the pouring rain and just to embrace being wet.

The biggest tree I’ve seen since I started was laying down across the trail and I had to climb around it. Saw a ton of newts and salamanders today, they must love how rainy and muddy it is. I am caked in mud. Did I mention it’s wet and muddy today? No matter, I push on with the Fontana Dam ‘Hilton’ shelter on my radar. The shelter has cell reception, and a solar charger for phones that a boy scout troop put in, and showers, or so I’ve heard down the trail. It’s not a real Hilton but compared to most of the shacks in the woods or camping it is. After another 22 mile day I made it just as it was getting dark. The lake looks beautiful. But it was just too rainy and cloudy, the solar charger is not putting out any juice. No charged phone for me, no mother's day for mom, but I did my best. I can get to town tomorrow and call. At least she will know that I was thinking of her and the help she gave me moving out of my apartment so that I could come on this adventure. Meow, Moss, Yeehaw, and the Maine Couple are here, as well as a ton of other friendly hikers I haven’t met yet. Big Man and Refugee are just a couple miles behind and should get in early in tomorrow.

All of the shelters have water sources somewhat nearby, some closer than others. This particular one was down a steep hill about 50 yards. When she came back up the hill she slipped on some mud and spilled her water. Sometimes, after a long day, it doesn’t take much. I thought she was going to cry, since the hill was so steep. So I offered to get water for the horses and made a few trips up and down the hill with the buckets.  Then I got to help feed the horses and become their friend.
