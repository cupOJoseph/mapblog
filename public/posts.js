  "post":"I spent the last two weeks in CO, attending ETH Denver as a hacker and mentor. I also spent 6 days in the mountains, skiing out West for the first time and going on adventures. It was a really great experience, and I definitely want to go back in the summer time. CO is a beautiful part of the country.<br><br>At Eth Denver I gave a workshop on building ERC-721 tokens on Ethereum.  You can watch it <a href='https://youtu.be/49G5eFFu_NE' >here.</a> I think a lot of the learning content in this space is either “Hello World” or really deep dives. The difference between the ends of this spectrum is really vast and many developers I’ve talked to have had a hard time getting past the many beginner tutorials. So the focus of my workshop was on practical integration, and we spent more than half of the time doing live coding and explaining everything as we go. For me, that’s the best way to learn.<br><br>After ETH Denver many of the organizers and participants went on a retreat to Breckenridge, CO, for skiing.  I met my Dad in Denver, who flew in from Boston. We drove together to Breckenridge and met up with some ETH Denver folks, but mostly skied just the two of us. It was an awesome place. We also did some day trips to some hot springs and went on a snow shoeing hike too. I bet it’s awesome there in the summer. One of the highlights was playing poker with friends, and my Dad totally hustling everyone. It’s funny to see this older guy come in and smoke a bunch of cockie young crytpo hotshots. It was a great trip. ",

  "post":"This is a letter to myself to reflect on where I am now, what is next, why I’m doing it, and give myself a reference for where I was when I return. <b> Today marks less than a month until I leave for my thru hike attempt of the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine.</b>  I’m planning to leave May 1st, 2019, and to go on a great adventure, which I hope to finish in just under 5 months.<br><br>Right now, I am 23 years old, relatively fit, medium length hair, and wearing a red sweatshirt that says Newport which I got for Christmas. I weigh 167 lbs, which is as much as I have ever weighed in my life. I used to exercise more, I used to write more code, I used to spend more time with friends, I used to go outside more. I wish I did those more, but maybe not doing them is a consequence of graduating college and going into ‘real life’. Maybe it’s just how it is. I’ve built a lot of great things in the last year, and had some significant accomplishments in terms of my business and projects, but I’ve also felt myself stagnating and not being as challenged as I used to be. This hike will be a great chance to make friends, to exercise all day, to be outside in the woods. But that’s not necessarily why I am taking 5 months off to do it.<br><br>What am I hoping and expecting to find on this hike? I’m not sure exactly. A trip. An adventure. A change. All of those for sure, but that doesn’t fully capture my eagerness to attempt this thru hike. I’m sure I will meet a lot of great people, see a lot of great things, and have some great experiences. But I think most of all I’m looking for a challenge: an experience that is also an accomplishment. I love being in the woods. I’m not afraid of the bears, or people, or logistics. I’m afraid I will miss something when I’m gone, I’m afraid relationships I care about will be strained, I’m afraid I won’t finish by the end of September and it will get too cold. I’ve been thinking about this hike for about three years. It seems now will be the best time in my life to finally take the leap and do it. I have no serious commitments, who knows when that will be true again.<br><br>I say thru hike ‘attempt’, but I don’t think I will quit. I know it will not be easy. I’m ready.",
